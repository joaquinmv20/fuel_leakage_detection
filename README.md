## Project Objective & Scope
The objective of this project is to utilize certification testing data from airplanes to develop a predictive model for the early detection of fuel leakages. This model aims to reduce unscheduled maintenance, decrease costs, and increase the availability of airplanes.

## Data Management
The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis, handling of missing and irrelevant values, detecting reliable flights, and preparing final datasets for modeling. Specific methods include PCA, handling outliers, and feature engineering.

## Model Selection
The project explores various machine learning models to predict fuel leakages, focusing on logistic regression and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) models. It involves detailed model evaluation and selection based on performance metrics.

## Business Implications
The project discusses the financial and strategic implications of implementing the predictive model, emphasizing the potential cost savings, increased safety, and competitive advantages for Airbus.

## Conclusion & Outlook
The final section of the project outlines the benefits of the predictive model for Airbus and suggests future steps for improving the model's accuracy and reliability.
